# 03-Password-Generator
## Description
This project was created to provide a tool for creating a more secure password based on the users specified criteria. The tool will ask questions that the user must input and then a password will randomly be generated that fits the criteria.

### How does it work?
- The user will click the Generate Password button and then be prompted to input the length of the desired password (the value must be between 8 and 128 characters to avoid the error message)
- After the length has been submitted, 4 questions will be asked to define which characters will be used,
    - Do you want Lowercase characters?
    - Do you want Uppercase characters?
    - Do you want Numbers?
    - Do you want Symbols?
- Once those questions are answered, the password will be generated randomly and printed in the UI
